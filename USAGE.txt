DIFFIE-HELLMAN KEY EXCHANGE - USAGE GUIDE
=========================================

FILES INCLUDED:
- main.cpp      : Main implementation with all required functions
- BigInt.h      : BigInteger header file
- BigInt.cpp    : BigInteger implementation
- fft.h         : Fast Fourier Transform header (used by BigInt)
- fft.cpp       : Fast Fourier Transform implementation

COMPILATION:
------------
g++ -std=c++14 -o diffie_hellman main.cpp BigInt.cpp fft.cpp

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
-------------------

Option 1: Interactive Menu (Run without arguments)
./diffie_hellman

You'll see a menu:
  1. 64-bit   (fast, ~1-3 minutes)
  2. 128-bit  (moderate, ~3-5 minutes)
  3. 256-bit  (slower, ~5-15 minutes)
  4. 512-bit  (REQUIRED for submission, ~10-30 minutes)

Option 2: Command-Line Argument
./diffie_hellman 64      # Fast testing
./diffie_hellman 128     # Moderate testing
./diffie_hellman 256     # Slower testing
./diffie_hellman 512     # Required for final submission

TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
-----------------------
- Use 64-bit or 128-bit for quick testing and debugging
- Use 512-bit for final submission and demonstration
- The 512-bit version is REQUIRED by the assignment

WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES:
----------------------
1. Generates a safe prime p (where both p and (p-1)/2 are prime)
2. Generates private keys for Alice and Bob
3. Computes public keys using modular exponentiation
4. Exchanges public keys and computes shared secrets
5. Verifies that both shared secrets match

NOTE:
-----
Safe prime generation is intentionally slow because safe primes are rare.
This is normal and expected behavior for cryptographic prime generation.
